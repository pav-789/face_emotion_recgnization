😊 Facial Expression Recognition System
Detect moods, decode faces, and log emotions in real time.

🔍 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Facial Expression Recognition System that uses machine learning and computer vision to identify human emotions from facial cues in real-time. Whether you're building smarter AI, studying human behavior, or just adding personality to your software—this system gets right to the feels.

📁 Key Components
1. Emotion Detection System
Core engine that captures live video, analyzes facial features, and classifies emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more using a pre-trained deep learning model.

2. Emotion Graph
Visualizes detected emotions over time using live graphs for a better understanding of emotional trends. Powered by Matplotlib/Plotly for clear data storytelling.

3. Emotion Logger
Logs real-time emotion data with timestamps to a file. Great for emotion analytics, behavioral research, or AI training datasets.

4. Emotion Log Viewer
Reads and displays logged emotions in a clean, user-friendly format. Makes it easy to review emotional activity post-session.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time facial expression detection
✅ Emotion data logging with timestamps
✅ Graphical analysis of emotional patterns
✅ Lightweight, beginner-friendly, and scalable
